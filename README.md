# 🗄️ Python Module 04 — Cyber Archives  
### Safe I/O, Streams and Error-Resilient Programs

**Author:** Bea  

This repository is part of a personal Python learning journey focused on  
clarity, mental models, and explainable code.

This module explores safe interaction with the external world:  
files, streams, and error handling.

The goal is not only to make programs work, but to **understand, structure, and explain** how Python should behave when dealing with real-world resources that may fail.

This module represents a key transition:

> from controlled in-memory logic  
> to unreliable external systems.

## 🎯 Module Objectives

By completing this module, the learner develops the ability to:

- Understand **Input / Output (I/O)** operations in Python  
- Work safely with files (reading and writing)  
- Use **streams** (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`) correctly  
- Apply **context managers** (`with`) to guarantee resource safety (RAII)  
- Handle errors gracefully using `try / except`  
- Build programs that **never crash**, even under failure scenarios  
- Produce **exact output**, strictly matching subject specifications  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

- File handling (`open`, read, write)  
- Manual resource management (`try / finally`)  
- Context managers (`with`)  
- Standard streams:
  - `stdin` — user input  
  - `stdout` — standard output  
  - `stderr` — alerts and diagnostics  
- Error handling:
  - `FileNotFoundError`  
  - `PermissionError`  
  - generic exceptions  
- Separation of concerns  
- Clean orchestration using `main()`

## 🧪 Exercises Overview

### 🔹 Exercise 0 — Ancient Text Recovery  
**Focus:** Safe file reading and error prevention.

- Reads a file from disk  
- Handles missing files gracefully  
- Demonstrates manual resource management using `try / finally`  

**Key takeaway:**  
> File access can fail; resources must always be released.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 1 — Archive Creation  
**Focus:** Controlled file writing and separation of responsibilities.

- Generates predefined archive entries  
- Writes data safely to a file  
- Separates data preparation from I/O operations  

**Key takeaway:**  
> Data logic and file operations should not be mixed.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2 — Stream Management  
**Focus:** Communication channels and streams.

- Reads input from `stdin`  
- Writes standard output to `stdout`  
- Sends alerts to `stderr`  

**Key takeaway:**  
> Not all output is the same: messages and alerts must be separated.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3 — Vault Security  
**Focus:** RAII and context managers.

- Uses `with` for safe file access  
- Guarantees automatic resource release  
- Clear separation between logic, I/O, and formatting  

**Key takeaway:**  
> Resource acquisition and release should be automatic and fail-safe.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4 — Crisis Response  
**Focus:** Error resilience and system stability.

- Simulates multiple failure scenarios  
- Handles different exceptions explicitly  
- Ensures the system always ends in a stable state  

**Key takeaway:**  
> Errors should never crash the system; they must be handled and reported.

---

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

Throughout this module, the following principles guide the design:

- One responsibility per function  
- Clear separation between:
  - orchestration (`main()`)  
  - business logic  
  - I/O operations  
- Exact output matching the subject  
- Readability and explainability over clever tricks  

This approach produces code that is:

- Easier to reason about  
- Easier to debug  
- Easier to maintain  
- Easier to explain

## 🚀 Final Notes

This module marks a shift from **writing scripts** to **building robust programs**.

Safe interaction with files, streams, and external resources is a foundational skill for real-world software development.

This module establishes that discipline clearly, structurally, and intentionally.
