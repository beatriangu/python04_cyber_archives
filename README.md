# Python Module 04 – Data Quest

This repository contains my solutions for **Python Module 04**, focused on
file handling, stream management, and understanding how data flows through
a program.

The exercises are designed to reinforce not only Python syntax, but also
core concepts such as resource safety, input/output streams, and predictable
program behavior.

## 🧪 Exercise Overview

### EX0 – Ancient Text Recovery
- Reads data from a text file.
- Handles missing files gracefully.
- Demonstrates safe file opening and closing.
- Focuses on exact output formatting.

### EX1 – Archive Creation
- Creates and writes a new archive file.
- Demonstrates controlled write operations.
- Emphasizes awareness of data overwriting risks.

### EX2 – Stream Management
- Uses standard input for user interaction.
- Separates standard output and error output.
- Demonstrates how `stdout` and `stderr` behave under redirection.
- Validated using shell redirections (`>`, `2>`).

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- File handling (`open`, read, write, close)
- Graceful error handling and resource management
- Standard streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`)
- Output redirection in Unix-based systems
- Clean, readable, and predictable program flow

---

## ✅ Code Quality
- Python 3 compliant
- Flake8 checked
- Clear separation of logic and execution
- No unnecessary complexity

## 🚧 Work in Progress
Exercises **EX3** and **EX4** will be completed next.
