# Python Module 04 – Cyber Archives

This repository contains my work for **Python Module 04**, focused on safe interaction with the external world: files, streams, and error handling.

The goal of this module is not only to make the code work, but to **understand, structure, and explain** how a Python program should behave when dealing with real-world resources that may fail.

---

## 🎯 Module Objectives

* Understand **Input / Output (I/O)** operations in Python
* Work safely with files (reading and writing)
* Learn the concept of **streams** (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`)
* Use **context managers** (`with`) to guarantee resource safety (RAII)
* Handle errors gracefully using `try / except`
* Build programs that **never crash**, even in crisis scenarios
* Produce **exact output**, strictly matching the subject specifications

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

* File handling (`open`, read, write)
* Manual resource management (`try / finally`)
* Context managers (`with` statement)
* Standard streams:

  * `stdin` (input)
  * `stdout` (standard output)
  * `stderr` (alerts and diagnostics)
* Error handling:

  * `FileNotFoundError`
  * `PermissionError`
  * generic exceptions
* Separation of concerns
* Clean program orchestration using `main()`

## 🧪 Exercises Overview

### 🔹 Exercise 0 – Ancient Text Recovery

**Focus:** Safe file reading and error prevention.

* Reads a file from disk
* Handles missing files gracefully
* Demonstrates manual resource management using `try / finally`

**Key takeaway:**

> File access can fail; resources must always be released.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 1 – Archive Creation

**Focus:** Controlled file writing and separation of responsibilities.

* Generates predefined archive entries
* Writes data safely to a file
* Separates data preparation from I/O operations

**Key takeaway:**

> Data logic and file operations should not be mixed.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2 – Stream Management

**Focus:** Communication channels and streams.

* Reads user input from `stdin`
* Outputs standard messages to `stdout`
* Sends alerts to `stderr`

**Key takeaway:**

> Not all output is the same: standard messages and alerts must be separated.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3 – Vault Security

**Focus:** RAII and context managers.

* Uses `with` for safe file access
* Guarantees automatic resource release
* Clean separation between logic, I/O, and formatting

**Key takeaway:**

> Resource acquisition and release should be automatic and fail-safe.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4 – Crisis Response

**Focus:** Error resilience and system stability.

* Simulates multiple failure scenarios
* Handles different exceptions explicitly
* Ensures the system always ends in a stable state

**Key takeaway:**

> Errors should never crash the system; they should be handled and reported.

---

## 🧩 Design Philosophy

Throughout this module, I followed these principles:

* One responsibility per function
* Clear separation between:

  * orchestration (`main()`)
  * logic
  * I/O operations
* Exact output matching the subject
* Readability and explainability over clever tricks

This approach makes the code:

* Easier to reason about
* Easier to debug
* Easier to defend during evaluation

---

## 🚀 Final Notes

This module represents a shift from "writing scripts" to **building robust programs**.

Understanding how to safely interact with the external world (files, streams, errors) is a foundational skill for real-world software development, and this module is a key step in that direction.
